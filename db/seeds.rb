    A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

    Example 1:
    
    Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

    Example 2:

    Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
    A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
    For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
    A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

    Example 1:
