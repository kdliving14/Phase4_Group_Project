Algorithm.create!( 
    title: 'Two Sum',
    description: 'Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
    
    You can return the answer in any order.

    Problem Type: Array
    
    Example 1: 
    
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]

    Example 3: 

    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]

    Constraints: 

    2 <= nums.length <= 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109
    Only one valid answer exists.'

    description: 'You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
    You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
    Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

    Problem Type: Array

    Example 1:

    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1)
    and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is
    not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

    Example 2:

    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transactions
      are done and the max profit = 0.
